The rules that govern how a cell evolves from one generation 
 to the next generation 
 are as follows:

if a cell 
 is dead in generation 
 then it becomes alive (or is born) in generation 
 if there are exactly 
 alive cells in its neighborhood in generation 
if a cell 
 is alive in generation 
 then it survives in generation 
 if there are an additional 
 or 
 alive cells in its neighborhood in generation 
note the an additional; this means that there must be a total of 
 or 
 alive cells in the neighborhood because 
 is also alive in generation 
all cells that do not fall into Rules 1 or 2 die, or remain dead in generation
